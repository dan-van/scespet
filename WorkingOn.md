todo: adding exposeEmpty support to define whether a 'scan(new Sum)' exposes the intial empty state (e.g. do you observer an accVol=0 reset at the start of the day?)
Current implementation is exposeEmpty=true

now getting all the tests to be un-ignored in TestMulti-Bucketing I think there's a problem with initialisation
