SCala Event Stream Processing Expression Toolkit

experiments in building "stream processing" expressions (i.e. functional reactive programming).
a core goal was that an expression on a single stream (e.g. of Double) would be applicable to a 'multi-stream' (i.e. a map of Key->Stream[Double])


My first proper bit of scala - warning: lots of code litter abound as I mess around with macros and anything new
Put on github to allow me to mess around with ideas on the train and at home, and have them integrate with my code at work
